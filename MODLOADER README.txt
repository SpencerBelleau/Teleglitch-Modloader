FOR VERSION 9.0

This is a modloader made for Teleglitch. it allows you to easily create mods for the game which can be combined with other mods (assuming no conflicts), made simpler without accidentally screwing up your base files and which won't be deleted when the game updates (though modloader will have to update, but that's simple).

To add mods, simply edit _modlist.txt in lua/usermods

Mods should be listed one per line, no gaps

Further instructions for mod creation are provided in the example mod's files.

NOTE: The example mod is not NOT enabled by default. While it's good if you want to see a little demonstration, it's not exactly a serious mod. Add it to _modlist.txt to enable it.

When the game first starts, you may have a black screen for a second or so. This is completely normal and due to the altered order of resource loading. Gameplay will not be affected.

Please report any major bugs to datsexyanon@gmail.com or in the thread.
